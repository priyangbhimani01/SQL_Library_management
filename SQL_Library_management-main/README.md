# SQL_Library_management

A multi-database Library Management System project leveraging SQL and NoSQL technologies, including PostgreSQL, MongoDB and Neo4j.

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates a comprehensive approach to managing a library database using various database technologies:

- **PostgreSQL** for relational data storage  
- **MongoDB** for document-oriented data  
- **Neo4j** for graph database relationships

The system supports typical library operations such as book inventory management, user tracking and borrowing history.

## Features

- Book management with relational and document databases  
- User and borrowing record tracking  
- Complex relationship mapping with Neo4j graph queries  
- Data visualization with ER diagrams

## Tech Stack

- JavaScript  
- Python (for data processing and scripts)  
- CSS & HTML (frontend interfaces)  
- Cypher (Neo4j queries)  
- PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Neo4j databases
